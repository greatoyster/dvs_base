# dvs_base

Some *generic* and relatively *stable* code about event-based vision from daily research and open source repository, intergrated in ROS framework.

# Current Plan

- Single and packed event representation

- Event temporal-spatial representation

- Generic trajectory representation

- Geometry transform representation

- IO function with numpy interface

- Experiment system

- Generic motion model representation

- Generic Gradient descent solver

# Future Plan

- Embedded visualization code in C++ and related RViz plugin

# Finished Part
